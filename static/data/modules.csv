Q/CMEE Induction + Bootcamp Intro,Samraat Pawar,s.pawar@imperial.ac.uk,1,1,1,"This module introduces the philosophy and structure of the CMEE Masters course and the Quantitative and Modelling-skills in Ecology and Evolution Centre for Doctoral Training (QMEE CDT), and kicks off the 2.5-week Bootcamp in Biological Computing shared by these two student cohorts. Over about 2.5 weeks, the Bootcamp will cover UNIX (and Shell scripting), LaTeX, Version control (using Git), Python and R. With the profusion of genomic, environmental and ecological information, the ability to develop automated, reproducible analyses of massive datasets using computer scripts and programs is an essential skill for any research student. The aim of the Computing Bootcamp is to introduce the basics of computing with focus on biological applications. The Bootcamp Intro component  (this week) focuses on training in fundamental tools of scientific computing: UNIX and Linux, shell scripting, \LaTeX, and Git. Throughout the 2.5 weeks of the Bootcamp, the teaching will be hands-on and informal, involving lectures interspersed with short exercises in class to reinforce concepts and techniques. You will also tackle longer exercises/problems during long computing practical sessions, some indepndently, and some in groups. These sessions will be  demonstrator-aided and are also an opportunity for you to catch up. Along with the Bootcamp, the week includes a number of induction events. You will also be provided with your course laptop (if needed). All lectures and practicals will be computer (laptop)-based. ","\begin{itemize}
\item Learn to format a computer, install Linux, and set it up. 
\item Learn basic hardware/software concepts in computing.
\item Learn to use the UNIX environment and the terminal for tasks ranging from data exploration to simple calculations and data processing.
\item  Learn to use \LaTeX~ for typesetting documents in a reproducible, consistent and elegant way.
\item Learn how and why to version control computer code with git.

Lundy Island Field Trip,Julia Schroeder,julia.schroeder@imperial.ac.uk,1,9,1,"This is a field trip to Lundy island, if the situation permits. If it is not possible to go, we will run this week as a virtual field course, which will cover the same learning aims. The entire island is designated as a “Site of Special Scientific Interest” because of its unique natural history. ","You will learn about life history evolution. You will gain a better understanding about life-history traits, trade-offs, about fitness, how to measure fitness, and how to measure behaviours. You will conduct observations and a mark-recapture analysis in a real-life research setting, and analyse a behavioural trade-off. You will learn how to collect life-history data in birds.",Practicalities:,"We need to leave Silwood very early on Monday to make it in time to catch our Helicopter. 4:00am means 4:00 in the middle of the night. Please be at the meeting point in time. 

Lundy is not connected to the mainland power grid, and therefore, electricity is limited. There is a generator so we will have power during daytime, but it usually shuts down at night. Therefore, bring headlights or a small torch so you can find your way back from the tavern to the accommodations without falling off a cliff. 
There is no doctor or pharmacy on the island. If you have a medical emergency you will have to call an emergency helicopter and you will be flown out, which, depending on your medical insurance, can be very expensive. If you suffer from any health issues that might be problematic in these circumstances, please contact the convenor early on. 
Lundy is remote, and the mobile phone network coverage is poor. It is likely that you will have no coverage, not even for text messages. There is no internet on Lundy. There is a pay phone in the tavern that you can use for emergencies. 
We will be flying by helicopter so luggage is limited to one luggage item per person that should not exceed 10kg. Luggage exceeding this may not be taken over, or you will have to pay rather high extra costs. Everyone can have one (small!) carry-on item that could be a laptop-bag or a camera backpack.
We will stay in accommodations with shared bed rooms (2 to 14 people). There is tap water (hot and cold), although it can be limited under certain circumstances and therefore if possible, do limit showering to 3-5 Minutes each.
There is a pub (Marisco Tavern) on Lundy, which will provide us with warm food for dinner. 
There is no cash machine or ATM on Lundy, or on the heliport on the mainland. You can, however, pay by card in the shop and tavern. 
Lundy is a windy, rocky outcrop in the Bristol Channel and it is end of November. It will be cold and wet. Do not underestimate the cold – with the wind chill it will easily be below freezing. We will spend long times outdoors, standing around, catching and monitoring birds. Bring warm clothing, gloves, hats and scarfs. It is highly recommended to bring sturdy outdoor shoes with insulating insoles, and windproof, warm winter jackets. It is highly recommended to bring long ski underwear. You will be cold. Thanks to the weight limitation of luggage, this means it is best to only bring functional clothing. Ask your convenor for advice for packing if in doubt. 
If you have, bring binoculars. There is a library in the tavern that holds some bird and other organismic ID guide books.
Bring your laptop.
There is a small, albeit real, possibility that a helicopter cannot fly on any given day, due to weather conditions. This could happen on our trip to and from Lundy. The former is not so problematic, but do expect it. If this happens on our return trip, this could mean that we will not return to the mainland before Saturday. It is important that you consider this and do not make any plans on the weekend that you cannot miss. When the helicopter cannot go there is no way to leave the island and then we are stuck. Consider this especially when you think about health/medical/travel/care issues (how much of a medical drug taken daily to bring, GP appointments, plane tickets, children or pets that are being cared for in your absence ect). Rumour has it that once the helicopter could not go on two consecutive days, and while we keep our fingers crossed that that is just a rumour, keep in mind that this is a possibility when making plans.
Generally, it is a field trip to a remote location. Expect changes in the time table, expect no luxurious conditions, expect to be exposed to the elements. Field biology can be rough, due to the environmental component. We will try to make everything go as smoothly as possible, but we cannot guarantee that everything will run according to plan.

Generalised Linear Models,Julia Schroeder,julia.schroeder@imperial.ac.uk,2,16,1,This module builds on the basic linear models introduced in the previous term to introduce some key concepts that allow linear models to be applied to a wider range of research problems. This will include using generalised linear models to handle count and binomial data - where residuals are not expected to follow a normal distribution - and the use of structured models to allow for non-independence in data and to control for known sources of variation in data.,"You will learn how to analyse and interpret linear models, linear mixed models, general linear models and generalised linear mixed models. You will be able to apply and choose the right model for your question and data, and you will be able to assess which variables to model as random or fixed factors.

This inherent dimensionality warrants large and complex data sets that are difficult to analyse.

In this module we will explore the methods used by behavioural ecologists to test hypotheses about the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape behaviour and the morphological traits enabling such behaviour to be effectively carried out. The course will touch upon a variety of behavioural ecology topics and provide case studies to show how experiments can be designed effectively and how behaviour can be appropriately quantified to test the question(s) posed. The course will use insect systems to study animal behaviour and ecology, in which students will design and undertake observations to test hypotheses they have raised. This includes studying bumblebees and/or mosquitoes, but ultimately this will depend on weather and insect stock conditions, so will be determined closer to the start of the module. ","1.
