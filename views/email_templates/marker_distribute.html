<p>Dear {{=name}},</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance for marking and assessing projects for the Silwood Masters programs. The students you have been assigned are listed below. </p>

<p>We use an <a href="https://silwoodmasters.info"> online system</a> for marking projects and the links below will take you to the marking sheet for each student you have been assigned. This includes a link to the marking assessment criteria for you to follow in preparing your report.</p>

{{=XML(links)}}

<p>Each of the above links to the report marking form will allow anyone to access it. Therefore, <b style='color:red'> do not forward this email to anyone else!</b></p>

The pdf version of each student's dissertation report can be found <a href = "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12vkP0t2D8WXr9tsiOxH5DL-jX6khIypY">here</a>.

Additional information and documents (including marking criteria) can be found on the <a href="https://silwoodmasters.info/"> online marking system</a> website.

<p>Please note:
<ul>
<li>The due dates for the reports: all marking must be completed before project vivas and the following exam board meetings.</li>
<li>The two markers (you and one other) must have agreed on a mark for the report before the start of the viva. A form to record the agreed mark will be included in the viva marking documentation. The viva dates will be emailed to you separately</li>
<li>Each student will make a presentation on her/his project before the date of the viva. We suggest that you submit your report mark after attending each student's presentation.
The presentation and viva schedules will be emailed to you separately. For the summer projects, the presentation schedule can also be found by visiting the <a href="http://freesymp.org"> FrEEC Symposium website</a>. You will also have to mark the presentation - information on this will also be emailed to you separately. </li>
</ul> </p>

<p>The project marking form will have instructions at the top along with a link to the marking criteria. In particular, please provide as many of your comments as possible as constructive feedback in open comments sections. If you do have confidential comments on the project that you do not wish the student to see, please use the private comments section: you can view this as 'Comments to Editors'!</p>

<p>You may <strong>save</strong> your marking at any time and the link will take you back to your progress so far. When you have completed the report, press the <strong>submit</strong> button: you will be forwarded to a static version of the report that contains a link to download a PDF.</p>

<p>  <b style='color:red'><strong> We would like to highlight that there is strong evidence that all of us draw unconscious associations and inaccurate judgements about people (Greenwald and Krieger, 2006), which can reflect in marking especially in face-to-face assessments. However, there is also evidence that recognising the existence of unconscious bias can help mitigate its impact: Greenwald, A. and Krieger, L. (2006) ‘Implicit bias: Scientific foundations’, California Law Review, pp. 945-967.</strong></b></p>
